"# poo-portfolio" 

Hello,

Project description: The project consists in developing a portfolio with an administration part.

Install the project: download the archive and extract it in the directory 'www' of Wamp (or other), modify the file config / db.php and adapt it to your configuration.

The database is in the / bdd folder and is called "portfolio".

To start the project, create a virtual host that points to the folder /public/index.php

Finally, I use the swiftmailer feature to send e-mails. For this to work, you will need to edit the /config/mail.php file. "
